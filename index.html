            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome! My name is Kayla Quadros and my pronouns are she/her. I'm a student in the MLIS program at IU, and I am specializing in Youth Services.</p>

            <p>This will be a career shift for me. I've been a licensed mental health counselor, working with youth and families, for over a decade, but recently decided to make the jump and pursue a career as a children's librarian.</p>

            <p>I have an orange tabby named after a cheese. Can you guess which one? (No, it's not Cheddar, but that is a really cute name for a cat &#128568;). Check out my <a href="pages/module6_cat.html">CATalog</a> page for some cheesy cat photos!</p>

            <p>My favorite animal is a raccoon. Those little trash pandas are so adorable, I wish I could have one as a pet! (Yes, I know they don't actually make good pets in real life, sadly). Alas, I must settle for watching videos of the cuddly critters and their silly shenanigans online. Visit my <a href="pages/module6_bffs.html">BFFs</a> page to get your daily dose of cuteness with one of my favorite videos. &#129437;</p>
